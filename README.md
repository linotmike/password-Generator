# Password Generator
This is a password generator that was not working and we were given a starter code and we were challanged to make it work. this was not that hard of a project but it took some time to make it work.
The repository contains a code for a website that generates random passwords that consists of letters that are upper and lower case and also numbers and special characters.
To make it work or to use it we just have to go to the website and follow the questions which are choose the length of the password? if we want the password to have an uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters and it will generate a random password for us.
